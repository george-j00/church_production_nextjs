          The St. Antony’s Jacobite Syrian Church, Mangalore, one of the oldest
          Syrian Orthodox Church in Dakshina Kannada Distict, and perhaps in the
          entire State of Karnataka, was established in 1937 under St.Anthonys
          Educational society Honavar by the Late Very Rev. Cor-episcopa George
          Pinto. (Brother) Fr.George Pinto was born in South Kanara to a Roman
          Catholic family. He started a brotherhood, the ‘ The Order of St.
          Antony’ in 1917 for the purpose of serving the poor and the needy in
          the Kanara region. In 1934 he was ordained as a Cor-episcopa of the
          Jacobite Syrian Church by Mor Julius, Apostolic Delegate of the
          Patriarch of Antioch, at the Manjinikkara Dayara, Kerala. He founded
          the ‘ West Coast Syrian Mission’ ( now known as St. Antony’s
          Educational Society-Honavar ) and established institutions and
          Churches in Mangalore, Brahmavar, Honavar and Bombay. He started about
          32 schools in the educationally backward area of North Kanara and also
          established a Hospital and orphanage at Honavar. Most of the schools
          were ceded to the state, post- Independence. With the blessings of Mor
          Julius, Rev. Fr. George Pinto Cor- Episcopa purchased about 1.50 acres
          of land at Jeppu, Mangalore and constructed the St. Antony’s Jacobite
          Syrian Church in 1937. A Higher Primary School was started in the
          1940’s to cater to the poor children of Jeppu area.

          Rev. Cor- Episcopa George Pinto was the first Director Vicar-General
          of St.Anthony’s Educational socity (Honavar Mission), an autonomous
          body directly under the Universal Syrian Orthodox Church and H.H. The
          Patriarch of Antioch. Thereafter he immersed himself in Christian
          social work in the villages of Kanara. He used to visit Bombay often
          to collect funds for running the schools, hospital and orphanages of
          the Honavar Mission. He had his Bombay office in ‘ Lusitania House’ in
          Dhobhi Talao at Kalabadevi. Reputed Parsee and European companies of
          Bombay extended regular financial support to the Honavar Mission.
          Priests from Kerala were appointed and put in charge of the Church and
          the School at Mangalore.

          In 1937 Rt. Rev. Kurian Vanichittattil Remban was appointed as the
          first Vicar of the ‘ Mission Church’ at Mangalore. After that Rev. Fr.
          Joseph Kallissery and Deacon Thomas were in charge of the Church and
          the Kannada Medium school at the Church premises. Sri. C.P.Verghese
          was appointed as the first Secretary / Trustee of the Church. Fr.
          Joseph passed away in 1948 while serving as Vicar and is entombed in
          the Church.

          Rev. Cor- episcopa George Pinto passed away at Bombay in 1954. He was
          succeeded by Rev. Cor -episcopa Jacob Kuriakal as the Director Vicar
          –General of Honavar Society. A crisis developed in the Church at
          Mangalore in 1960, when the then Vicar attempted to make the Church
          and School his personal property. As the founder Rev. George Pinto had
          wisely bought all the properties and built up institutions under a
          trust owing allegiance to H.H. Patriarch of Antioch, the attempt to
          swindle the property could be fought legally. A long legal battle
          ensued in the late ‘60’s and ended after 2 decades, when the High
          Court of Karnataka passed judgement in favour of the Trust and ordered
          eviction of the interlopers. In the protracted legal battle fought to
          protect the valuable Church property, the role of late Rev fr MP
          George and Sri. C. P. Verghese in assisting Rev. Jacob Kurikal is note
          worthy. During the Apostolic visit to Mangalore in 1982, H.H. The
          Patriarch of Antioch, decorated Sri. C.P. Verghese as Chevalier of the
          Jacobite Syrian Church.

          After the demise of Very Rev. Cor episcopa Jacob Kuriakal in 1988 at
          Bombay, the then Manager, Rev. Thomas Abraham took over as Director
          Vicar-General of St. Antony’s Educational Society. The Churches and
          Institutions flourished under the able leadership of both Rev. Kor-
          episcopa Jacob Kurikal and Rev. Kor- episcopa Thomas Abraham.
          Unfortunately Rev. Thomas Abraham died prematurely in a road accident
          in 1989 and is entombed in the Church. After that H.G. Mor Benjamin
          Osthatheos was appointed Director of Honavar Mission. On May 27 th ,
          1990 H.G. Gheeverghese Mor Polycarpose took over as Director / Bishop
          of the St. Antony’s Educational Society, Honavar. The Churches and
          Institutions of Honavar Mission developed and thrived because of the
          vision and leadership qualities of Mor Polycarpose Gheeverghese
          metropolitan.
